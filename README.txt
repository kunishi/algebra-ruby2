Preface

This is a library for mathematical computations. Our purpose is to express the
mathematical object naturally in Ruby. Though it is not operated fast, we can
see the algorithm of the mathematical processing not in black box but in
scripts.

This library is in development stage. At present, things we can handle are as
follows:
   
 *  One-variate polynomial
     +  Fundamental operations (addition, multiplication, quotient/remainder,
        ...)
     +  factorization
     +  Galois group
   
 *  Multi-variate polynomial
     +  Fundamental operations (addition, multiplication, ...)
     +  factorization
     +  Creating Groebner-basis, quotient/remainder by Groebner-basis.
   
 *  Algebraic systems
     +  Creating quotient fields
     +  Creating residue class fields
     +  Operating matrices
     +  Operating permutation groups
   
 *  Sets and Maps

Installation

Install Ruby (See: <URL:http://www.ruby-lang.org/> ).

After expanding this archive, do
ruby install.rb

Then all files and directories under lib are copyed in the directory where Ruby
can load.

To accelerate calculation, it is better to use an extension library of rational
number: (<URL:http://blade.nagaokaut.ac.jp/~sinara/ruby/rational/> than to use
the stardard library rational.rb.

Usage and Samples

See index.html in doc directory, where manuals and sample codes are.
